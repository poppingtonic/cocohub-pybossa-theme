            <h2>Represent your community</h2>
            <p>
              In our first project series, you can go to <a href="http://cocohub.cc/project/category/featured/">Projects</a> and search for a language you'd like to contribute to. When you find it, join in and translate a few sentences. If you don't find the language you're looking for, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@cocohub.cc">info</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this project is maintained by a few people, we believe in the power that communities have
                over their common problems, and lack of access to aligned sentences is a big one for people who
                want to do research in machine translation. The problem is even bigger in the field of image
                captioning. <a href="">Join us</a> and represent your community by creating a dataset that will be
                used by the next few generations of researchers in NLP!
